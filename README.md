Compute final course grades for students based on percentage scores using a function.  Each semester, professors across the land must compute grades for their students based on some sort of university-wide standard. The process often involves taking individual scores computed in percent, averaging them together, and then looking up the average grade in a table to determine a letter grade to submit for the course. Here, you will program the part of this process that converts a numerical score (0 through 100) to a letter grade (F through A+). You will do this by writing and calling a function named letterGrade() that accepts a float as an input argument and returns a string that refers to the letter grade. Letter grades are assigned based on the table below where the ranges do not include the maximum value ( -> means up to but not including â€¦ it is not a Python operator). For example, an average of 85.00 earns an A- and 84.99 earns a B+. letter grade A+ A A- B+ B B- C+ C C- F percent range >=95 90->95 85->90 80->85 75->80 70->75 65->70 60->65 55->60 <55
